Circular Slide Rule

## run

`python3 draw.py <angle1: float> <angle2: float>`

- it requires [pygame](https://pygame.org) to run
- angles are in degrees, not in radians

## TODO

1. interactive ui
  - 2880 by 2880 image is too big to handle in real time
2. print-able images
3. stuffs inside the smaller disk
  - is sqrt okay? it's easy to calc sqrt without extra marks
